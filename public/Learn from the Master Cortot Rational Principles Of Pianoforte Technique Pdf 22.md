If you are wondering who Alfred Cortot was and why his pianoforte technique is so important, here is a brief introduction. Alfred Cortot was born in 1877 in Nyon, Switzerland. He studied piano at the Paris Conservatoire, where he won the first prize in 1896. He then pursued a successful career as a soloist, chamber musician, conductor, and teacher. He was especially famous for his interpretations of Chopin, Schumann, Liszt, and French composers. He also founded the Ãcole Normale de Musique de Paris, where he taught many prominent pianists, such as Clara Haskil, Dinu Lipatti, Samson FranÃ§ois, and Vlado Perlemuter.
 
Cortot's pianoforte technique was based on his observation and analysis of the natural movements of the hand and arm. He believed that by following these movements, the pianist could achieve a more relaxed, efficient, and expressive playing. He also emphasized the importance of musical understanding and imagination, as well as the development of a good ear and a refined touch. He wrote several books and articles on piano pedagogy, but his most famous and influential work is Rational Principles Of Pianoforte Technique, which was first published in 1928. In this book, he explains his method in detail and provides exercises and examples for each topic.
