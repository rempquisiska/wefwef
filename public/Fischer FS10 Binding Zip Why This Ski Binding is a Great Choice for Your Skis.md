# Fischer FS10 Binding Zip: A Review
 
If you are looking for a reliable and easy-to-adjust ski binding, you might want to consider the Fischer FS10 Binding Zip. This binding is part of the Fischer Alpine Bindings collection, which offers a range of bindings for different purposes and levels of skiing[^1^]. The FS10 Binding Zip is designed for beginner to intermediate skiers who want a comfortable and secure fit on their skis.
 
The FS10 Binding Zip features a Z-DIN range of 2 to 7.5, which means it can accommodate skiers with different weights and abilities. The binding also has a brake width of 78 mm, which fits most standard ski widths. The binding is compatible with both adult and junior ski boots, thanks to its adjustable toe height and heel piece[^1^]. The binding also has a GW (GripWalk) feature, which means it can work with boots that have a rubber sole for walking comfort[^1^].

One of the main advantages of the FS10 Binding Zip is its fast and easy adjustment system. The binding has a zip feature that allows you to adjust the length of the binding without any tools. You simply pull the zip tab on the heel piece and slide it to the desired position. The binding has a scale that shows you the correct length for your boot size. Once you have adjusted the length, you simply lock the zip tab in place and you are ready to go[^2^]. This feature makes it convenient to switch between different boots or share your skis with someone else.
 
The FS10 Binding Zip also offers a smooth and stable performance on the slopes. The binding has a freeflex system that allows the ski to flex naturally under the binding, which improves the ski's contact with the snow and reduces the risk of losing balance[^1^]. The binding also has a full diagonal toe piece that releases sideways in case of a fall, which reduces the chance of injury[^1^]. The binding also has a low stand height of 21 mm, which gives you more control and feedback from your skis[^1^].
 
The FS10 Binding Zip is a great option for skiers who want a simple and versatile binding that can adapt to different boots and conditions. The binding is easy to use, adjust, and maintain, and it offers a good balance of comfort, safety, and performance. The binding is also affordable and durable, making it a good value for money.
  
If you are interested in buying the Fischer FS10 Binding Zip, you might want to know how it compares to other bindings in the market. One of the closest competitors of the FS10 Binding Zip is the Fischer RC4 Z11 GW Powerrail Brake 78 [G] binding, which is also part of the Fischer Alpine Bindings collection. This binding has a similar Z-DIN range of 3 to 11, a brake width of 78 mm, and a GW feature. However, this binding has a higher stand height of 24 mm, a different toe piece design, and a powerrail system that requires tools to adjust the length. The RC4 Z11 GW Powerrail binding is more suitable for advanced skiers who want a higher performance and more precision from their bindings.
 
Another competitor of the FS10 Binding Zip is the Marker Squire 11 ID Ski Bindings 2022, which is a popular binding from another brand. This binding has a Z-DIN range of 3 to 11, a brake width of 90 mm, and an ID feature that works with both alpine and touring boots. However, this binding has a higher stand height of 22 mm, a different heel piece design, and a screw system that requires tools to adjust the length. The Marker Squire 11 ID Ski Bindings 2022 are more suitable for intermediate to advanced skiers who want a versatile and lightweight binding that can handle different terrains and modes.
 
As you can see, the Fischer FS10 Binding Zip has its own strengths and weaknesses compared to other bindings in the market. Depending on your preferences and needs, you might find the FS10 Binding Zip to be the best option for you or not. The best way to decide is to try out the binding yourself and see how it feels on your skis. You can find the FS10 Binding Zip at your local Fischer dealer or online at various websites.
