# How to Use LORENTZ COMPASS 3.0.10.9 12l for Solar Pumping Systems
 
LORENTZ COMPASS is a software tool for designing, planning and specifying solar pump systems. It allows you to simulate different scenarios and compare the performance and costs of different pump models and configurations. In this article, we will show you how to use LORENTZ COMPASS 3.0.10.9 12l, the latest version of the software, to design a solar pumping system for your water needs.

## Step 1: Download and Install LORENTZ COMPASS
 
To download and install LORENTZ COMPASS, you need to register as a LORENTZ partner on their website[^4^]. You will receive an email with a link to download the software and activate your license ID. Follow the instructions on the email and on the website to complete the installation process. You will also need to install Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 if you don't have it already on your computer[^5^].
 
## Step 2: Launch LORENTZ COMPASS
 
Once you have installed LORENTZ COMPASS, you can launch it from the shortcut on your desktop or from the Start menu. You will see a welcome screen with some options to start a new project, open an existing project, or access some tutorials and help files. For this example, we will start a new project by clicking on the "New Project" button.
 
## Step 3: Enter Project Details
 
The first step in designing a solar pumping system is to enter some basic information about your project, such as the name, location, customer, and description. You can also choose the language, currency, and units of measurement for your project. You can enter these details in the "Project" tab on the left side of the screen.
 
## Step 4: Define Water Demand
 
The next step is to define how much water you need and when you need it. You can enter these details in the "Water Demand" tab on the left side of the screen. You can choose from three options: constant flow rate, daily volume, or irrigation area. For each option, you can specify the water demand for each month of the year, or use some default values based on your location and climate. You can also adjust the water demand for different days of the week or different hours of the day.
 
## Step 5: Select Pump Model
 
The next step is to select a suitable pump model for your water demand and site conditions. You can do this in the "Pump Selection" tab on the left side of the screen. You can choose from a range of LORENTZ pump models, such as PS2, PSk2, PSk3, PS-CS-F, PS-B, or PS-Pool. For each model, you can see some technical specifications, such as flow rate, head, power consumption, and efficiency. You can also see some graphical representations of the pump performance curves and operating points.

## Step 6: Configure Pump System
 
The next step is to configure your pump system with some additional components and settings. You can do this in the "System Configuration" tab on the left side of the screen. You can specify some parameters such as suction lift, discharge pressure, pipe diameter, pipe length, pipe material, fittings, valves, filters, tanks, sensors, controllers, and accessories. You can also adjust some settings such as speed control, timers, hybrid power sources, dry run protection, pressure control, level control, and remote monitoring.
 
## Step 7: Calculate PV Array Size
 
The next step is to calculate how many solar panels you need to power your pump system. You can do this in the "PV Array Sizing" tab on the left side of the screen. You can choose from a range of LORENTZ PV modules or enter your own custom modules. For each module type, you can see some technical specifications such as power output, voltage, current, and efficiency. You can also see some graphical representations of the PV array layout, the IV curve, and the MPPT range. You can adjust some parameters such as tilt angle, azimuth angle, shading factor, temperature coefficient,
