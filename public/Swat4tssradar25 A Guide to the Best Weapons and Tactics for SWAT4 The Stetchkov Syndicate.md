# How to Use ArcGIS Desktop 10.5 for Spatial Analysis
 
ArcGIS Desktop 10.5 is a powerful desktop GIS software that enables you to perform spatial analysis on various types of data. Spatial analysis is the process of examining the locations, attributes, and relationships of features in spatial data. You can use spatial analysis to answer questions such as:

- Where are the most suitable locations for a new facility?
- How are different regions affected by environmental factors?
- What are the patterns and trends of population distribution?
- How can I optimize the routes and schedules of service delivery?

In this article, we will show you how to use some of the common spatial analysis tools in ArcGIS Desktop 10.5, such as:

- Buffer: Creates areas of a specified distance around features.
- Clip: Extracts a subset of features that fall within a specified boundary.
- Intersect: Computes the geometric intersection of multiple feature classes.
- Dissolve: Aggregates features based on specified attributes.
- Spatial Join: Combines attributes from one feature class with another based on spatial relationships.

To follow along, you will need to have ArcGIS Desktop 10.5 installed on your computer. You can download it from [here](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-desktop/overview). You will also need some sample data, which you can download from [here](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/get-started/installation-guide/sample-data.htm).
  
## Step 1: Create a new map document
 
To start a new spatial analysis project, you need to create a new map document in ArcMap, which is one of the applications in ArcGIS Desktop. A map document contains the data layers, symbology, layout, and other settings for your map. To create a new map document:

1. Open ArcMap from the Start menu or by double-clicking the ArcMap icon on your desktop.
2. In the ArcMap - Getting Started dialog box, click Blank Map and click OK.
3. A new map document will open with an empty data frame. You can save your map document at any time by clicking File > Save or Save As.

## Step 2: Add data layers to your map
 
To perform spatial analysis, you need to add some data layers to your map. Data layers are collections of geographic features that have a common theme, such as roads, rivers, or cities. You can add data layers from various sources, such as local files, databases, web services, or online maps. To add data layers to your map:

1. In ArcMap, click the Add Data button on the Standard toolbar.
2. In the Add Data dialog box, browse to the folder where you stored the sample data that you downloaded earlier.
3. Select the following shapefiles and click Add:
    - Cities.shp: Contains point features representing major cities in the world.
    - Countries.shp: Contains polygon features representing countries in the world.
    - Rivers.shp: Contains line features representing major rivers in the world.
4. The data layers will be added to your map and listed in the table of contents on the left side of the ArcMap window. You can change the order, visibility, and symbology of the data layers by right-clicking them and choosing the appropriate options.

## Step 3: Perform spatial analysis using geoprocessing tools
 
To perform spatial analysis on your data layers, you can use geoprocessing tools that are available in ArcGIS Desktop. Geoprocessing tools are functions that perform operations on geographic data, such as
